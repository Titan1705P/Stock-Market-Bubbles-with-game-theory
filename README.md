# Analysing Stock Market Bubbles with game theory

##Introduction

Economic bubbles and subsequent bursts have been defining moments for humans
several times in history. Notable examples include the Dutch Tulip Mania in the 17th
century, Great depression of the 1920s, the Dot-Com bubble in the 90s, and recently the
Covid-time stock market rally. An economic bubble occurs when out of boundedly rational
traits like herd mentality, conformance, cognitive biases, etc the value of an asset is driven
way above its fundamental value, only to come crashing down later.

As markets are essentially made of multiple agents interacting with one another, all with
their own beliefs, expectations about the future and strategies, game theory provides a
strong framework to analyze market behavior.

Evolutionary game theory considers an ecosystem of multiple agents, having a
demographic of strategies. The agents play games among each other across many
generations and the strategy demographics can change. The ecosystem can be invaded by
new strategies, and that can change the demographics too. I will be using this framework to
look at the different trading strategies different agents can have, how hype and negative
news ‘invade’ the strategy space and individual incentives driving the boom and bust.
